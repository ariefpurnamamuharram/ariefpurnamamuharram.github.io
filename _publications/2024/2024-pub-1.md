  Critical illness is a condition that requires special attention, as it often involves life-threatening situations with a higher mortality rate. Attention is further focused on diabetic patients, who have recently become common comorbid cases among critically ill patients. Patients with these conditions are often prone to hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia due to the nature of critical illness and diabetes itself. Intensive Insulin Therapy (IIT) is known to be beneficial in maintaining blood glucose levels at the optimal target in such patients. However, the application of IIT is not straightforward. To date, there is no standardized IIT protocol, and its use is highly dependent on the expertise of each clinician. Moreover, each protocol does not always guarantee the maintenance of blood glucose levels because it depends on the patient's response to insulin, while the protocol is designed to be general. With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML), a personalized IIT can be developed to address this issue. With the power of data, AI algorithms can analyze and assist in creating personalized IITs according to the patient's condition, with the goal of maintaining 2 their blood glucose levels. In this review, we present a future directive on the potential role of AI in creating personalized IITs for critically ill diabetic patients, as well as the challenges to be overcome in the development process.<br /><i><b>Keywords:</b> Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Intensive Insulin Therapy, Diabetes Mellitus, Critically Ill Patients</i>
