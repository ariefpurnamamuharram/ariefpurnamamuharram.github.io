abstract: >-
  The prevalence of DM in Indonesia, the fourth most populous country in the world, has increased by more than 50% in the past 5 years, from 6,9% in 2013 to 10,9% in 2018, of which most of the were Type-2 (T2DM). Furthermore, >70% of cases were undiagnosed and among those receiving treatment, only <30% achieved the blood glucose target. These factors lead high rates of complications and health cost which further complicates the problem of DM in Indonesia. Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) is one of strategy to overcome this problem and well-known to give good positive outcome. In past few years, many smartphone applications are developed to support DSME-behavior among DM patients. However, none of these applications/approach are specifically designed for DM patients in Indonesia. The aim of this research is to develop and validate DM EduCorner as a standardized smartphone-based application for facilitating diabetes education among DM patients in Indonesia.<br /><i><b>Keywords:</b> Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetes Education, Smartphone Application</i>
